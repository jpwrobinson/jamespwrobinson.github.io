&lt;p&gt;Repeated bouts of coral bleaching threaten the long-term persistence of coral reefs and associated com- munities. Here, we document the short- and long-term impacts of heatwave events on coral and fish assemblages, based on regular surveys of 18 reefs of the granitic islands of Seychelles over 23 yr. Extreme heat events in 1998 and 2016 led to bleaching-associated declines in coral cover, whilst between these years there was an interim period of coral recovery on some reefs. Coral decline and recovery were primarily due to changes in the cover of branching coral, particularly those from the families Acroporidae and Pocilloporidae. Surveys during the 2016 bleaching found that 95% of the 468 Acropora and Pocillopora colonies observed were either bleached or recently dead. The extent of bleaching and subsequent mortality were best explained by a priori assessments of community susceptibility to heat stress. One year later (2017), coral cover had fallen by 70% and average coverage across the 18 reefs was at 6%, sim- ilar to levels recorded in 2005, 7 yr after the 1998 bleaching. Decline in coral following the 2016 bleaching coincided with reduced abundance of fish &amp;lt; 11 cm TL, particularly corallivores, invertivores and mixed diet feeders. These changes are likely to foreshadow more widespread loss once the habitat structure erodes. Accordingly, 7 yr after the 1998 bleaching, when coral skeletons and reef structure had collapsed on some reefs, abundance of both large- and small-bodied fish had declined. We show that fluctuation in the cover of branching coral is positively associated with changes in the abundance of small-bodied fish which contribute to eco- logical processes and high diversity, suggesting branching corals are a keystone structure. Increased frequency of bleaching threatens the capacity of branching corals to fully recover after disturbances, reducing the amplitude of boom bust cycles of these corals and the keystone habitat structure they provide reef fish.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uncovering drivers of juvenile coral density following mass bleaching</title>

&lt;div data-badge-details=&#34;right&#34; data-badge-type=&#34;medium-donut&#34; data-doi=&#34;10.1007/s00338-019-01785-w&#34; data-hide-no-mentions=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;altmetric-embed&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thermally induced mass coral bleaching is globally responsible for major losses of coral cover. Coral recovery from mass coral disturbances like the 2016 bleaching event hinges on successful recruitment of new coral colonies to the existing population. Juvenile corals as a life history stage represent survival and growth of new recruits. As such, habitat preferences of juvenile corals and how environmental parameters interact to drive coral recovery following a mass bleaching disturbance are important research areas. To expand our knowledge on this topic, we compared juvenile coral densities from before the 2016 bleaching event with those after the disturbance and identified abiotic and biotic characteristics of 21 reefs in the inner Seychelles that predict juvenile coral densities. Our results show that following the 2016 bleaching event, juvenile coral densities were significantly reduced by about 70%, with a particularly large decline in juvenile Acropora. Macroalgae present a large obstacle to survival of juvenile corals in a post-bleaching setting, but their influence varies as a function of herbivore biomass, reef structure, and reef type. Higher biomass of herbivorous fish weakens the negative effect of macroalgae on juvenile corals, and structural complexity on granitic reefs is a strong positive predictor of juvenile coral density. However, structural complexity on carbonate or patch reefs was negatively related to juvenile coral density, highlighting the impor- tance of considering interactive terms in analyses. Our study emphasises the importance of habitat for juvenile coral abundance at both fine and seascape scales, adding to the literature on drivers of reef rebound potential following severe coral bleaching.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What happens to fisheries when coral reefs bleach?</title>
      <link>https://jpwrobinson.github.io/post/sey-nee/</link>

      <guid>https://jpwrobinson.github.io/post/sey-nee/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is my &lt;a href=&#34;https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/channels/521-behind-the-paper/posts/40032-what-happens-to-fisheries-when-coral-reefs-bleach&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Behind the Paper&lt;/a&gt; blog posted on Nature Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long-term datasets and an international collaboration uncovered climate impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A marine heatwave that turned coral reefs into seaweed fields has made reef fisheries less predictable and more productive, impacting small-scale fishers over 20 years later. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0715-z&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;In our new paper&lt;/a&gt;, we document how a mass coral bleaching changed the composition of fish communities, and how this led an increase in the amount of fish caught by artisanal fishers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research was the result of a collaboration between nine ecologists and fisheries scientists working across three countries for over 20 years. I want to explain why teamwork and sharing monitoring data were critical to the success of our study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When coral reefs are exposed to heat stress and corals bleach, complex and diverse underwater seascapes can turn into flat rubble habitats that are easily overgrown with seaweeds. Coral reefs also provide food and employment for billions of people - by reducing fish habitat, bleaching is expected to lower fisheries&amp;rsquo; productivity and so impact food security in the tropics. But fisheries landing data do not exist for most reefs, meaning we have very little empirical evidence of how climate change will affect tropical food security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link between coral bleaching and reef fisheries is complex. Corals can recover, and fish can be slow to respond to habitat changes. The seaweeds that replace corals, though providing a less complex habitat, can be highly productive and support several species of fish important to artisanal fishers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work in Seychelles, an island group in the Indian Ocean where, in 1998, a mass bleaching event caused &amp;gt;90% of corals in the inner island group to die. Since 1994, our team have collaborated with Seychelles Fishing Authority (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfa.sc/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SFA&lt;/a&gt;) and other organisations to collect an underwater time-series that has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14140&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;highly influential for understanding climate impacts on coral reefs&lt;/a&gt;. Seychelles is also a nation of fishers, and SFA have collected data on small-scale catches from coral reefs for over 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; &gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Reef fishery catch survey by technicians with Seychelles Fishing Authority. Surveys record the weight and identity of species caught by small-scale trap fishermen.&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The datasets are exceptional: from 1994 to 2016, SFA spent almost 6,000 days talking to fishermen to catalogue over 40,000 catches, while scuba divers spent 1,000&amp;rsquo;s of hours underwater counting over 60,000 reef fish. These data were a unique opportunity to study long-term climate impacts, and all that was left was interpretation: we turned noisy information into ecological patterns with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jpwrobinson/prod-instability&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R code and statistical models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found that catches increased or were stable in the 20 years following bleaching, which coincided with higher numbers of herbivores on the reef. However, overgrowth by seaweeds at some reefs led to greater spatial variation in habitat types and, as fish species started to associate with either seaweed or coral habitats, the variability in catch sizes also increased. Our findings suggest that bleached reefs can still provide food, but their fisheries are less predictable, and may become dominated by seaweed-feeding rabbitfishes.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;image2.png&#34; /&gt;



&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; &gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;The 1998 bleaching event caused &amp;gt;90% coral mortality and led to habitat collapse. Over the next 20 years, reefs either recovered branching coral structure or underwent a regime shift to macroalgal states.&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was only possible because our collaboration allowed us to combine fishery-dependent (catches) with fishery-independent (underwater) information spanning over 20 years. By drawing on the expertise of ecologists, statisticians, and fisheries scientists, we were able to present several lines of evidence that linked complex ecosystem changes to fishers&amp;rsquo; catches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coral reefs will continue to change as the planet warms - such collaborative and interdisciplinary research will be critical if we are to detect and adapt to future climate impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Productive instability of coral reef fisheries after climate-driven regime shifts</title>

&lt;div data-badge-details=&#34;right&#34; data-badge-type=&#34;medium-donut&#34; data-doi=&#34;10.1038/s41559-018-0715-z&#34; data-hide-no-mentions=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;altmetric-embed&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tropical coastal communities are highly reliant on coral reefs, which provide nutrition and employment for millions of people. Climate-driven coral bleaching events are fundamentally changing coral reef ecosystems and are predicted to reduce produc- tivity of coral reef fish and fisheries, with significant implications for food security and livelihoods. Yet evidence of long-term bleaching impacts on coral reef fishery productivity is lacking. Here, we analyse over 20 years of fish abundance, catch and habitat data to assess long-term impacts of climate-driven coral mass mortality and regime shifts on nearshore artisanal coral reef fisheries in the Seychelles. Contrary to expectations, total catch and mean catch rates were maintained or increased after coral bleaching, consistent with increasing abundance of herbivorous target species in underwater surveys, particularly on macroalgal-dominated reefs. Catch instability increased as habitats followed divergent post-disturbance trajectories and the distribution of target species became more spatially variable, potentially impacting fisher incomes and local market supply chains. Although coral bleaching increased fishery dependence on herbivore species, our results show that climate-impacted reefs can still provide livelihoods and fish protein for coastal communities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Environmental conditions and herbivore biomass determine coral
reef benthic community composition: implications for quantitative
baselines</title>

&lt;p&gt;Our ability to understand natural constraints on coral reef benthic communities requires quantitative assessment of the relative strengths of abiotic and biotic processes across large spatial scales. Here, we combine underwater images, visual censuses and remote sensing data for 1,566 sites across 34 islands spanning the central- western Pacific Ocean, to empirically assess the relative roles of abiotic and grazing processes in determining the prevalence of calcifying organisms and fleshy algae on coral reefs. We used regression trees to identify the major predictors of benthic composition and to test whether anthropogenic stress at inhabited islands decouples natural relationships. We show that sea surface temperature, wave energy, oceanic productivity and aragonite saturation strongly influence benthic community composition; over- looking these factors may bias expectations of calcified reef states. Maintenance of grazing biomass above a relatively low threshold (~ 10–20 kg ha-1) may also prevent transitions to algal-dominated states, providing a tangible management target for rebuilding overexploited herbivore populations. Biophysical relationships did not decouple at inhabited islands, indicating that abiotic influences remain important macroscale processes, even at chronically dis-turbed reefs. However, spatial autocorrelation among inhabited reefs was substantial and exceeded abiotic and grazing influences, suggesting that natural constraints on reef benthos were superseded by unmeasured anthropogenic impacts. Evidence of strong abiotic influences on reef benthic communities underscores their importance in specifying quantitative targets for coral reef management and restoration that are realistic within the context of local conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enhancing Climate Change Research With Open Science</title>

&lt;p&gt;Climate change research aims to understand global environmental change and how it will impact nature and society. The broad scope of climate change impacts means that successful adaptation and mitigation efforts will require an unprecedented collaboration effort that unites diverse disciplines and is able to rapidly respond to evolving climate issues (IPCC, 2014). However, to achieve this aim, climate change research practices need updating: key research findings remain behind journal paywalls, and scientific progress can be impeded by low levels of reproducibility and transparency (Ellison, 2010; Morueta-Holme et al., 2018), individual data ownership (Hampton et al., 2015), and inefficient research workflows (Lowndes et al., 2017). Furthermore, the level of public interest and policy engagement on climate change issues relies on fast communication of academic research to public institutions, with the result that the societal impact of climate change studies will differ according to their public availability and exposure. Here, we argue that by adopting open science (OS) principles, scientists can advance climate change research and accelerate efforts to mitigate impacts; especially for highly vulnerable developing regions of the world where research capacity is limited. We underscore the specific benefits of OS in raising the academic and societal impact of climate change research using citation and media metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fishing degrades size structure of coral reef fish communities</title>
      <link>https://jpwrobinson.github.io/publication/robinson2017-xm/</link>

&lt;div data-badge-details=&#34;right&#34; data-badge-type=&#34;medium-donut&#34; data-doi=&#34;10.1111/gcb.13482&#34; data-hide-no-mentions=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;altmetric-embed&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fishing pressure on coral reef ecosystems has been frequently linked to reductions of large fishes and reef fish biomass. Associated impacts on overall community structure are, however, less clear. In size-structured aquatic ecosystems, fishing impacts are commonly quantified using size spectra, which describe the distribution of individual body sizes within a community. We examined the size spectra and biomass of coral reef fish communities at 38 US- affiliated Pacific islands that ranged in human presence from near pristine to human population centers. Size spectra ‘steepened’ steadily with increasing human population and proximity to market due to a reduction in the relative biomass of large fishes and an increase in the dominance of small fishes. Reef fish biomass was substantially lower on inhabited islands than uninhabited ones, even at inhabited islands with the lowest levels of human presence. We found that on populated islands size spectra exponents decreased (analogous to size spectra steepening) linearly with declining biomass, whereas on uninhabited islands there was no relationship. Size spectra were steeper in regions of low sea surface temperature but were insensitive to variation in other environmental and geomorphic covariates. In contrast, reef fish biomass was highly sensitive to oceanographic conditions, being influenced by both oceanic productivity and sea surface temperature. Our results suggest that community size structure may be a more robust indicator than fish biomass to increasing human presence and that size spectra are reliable indicators of exploitation impacts across regions of different fish community compositions, environmental drivers, and fisheries types. Size- based approaches that link directly to functional properties of fish communities, and are relatively insensitive to abiotic variation across biogeographic regions, offer great potential for developing our understanding of fishing impacts in coral reef ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Testing and recommending methods for fitting size spectra to data</title>

&lt;div data-badge-details=&#34;right&#34; data-badge-type=&#34;medium-donut&#34; data-doi=&#34;10.1111/2041-210X.12641&#34; data-hide-no-mentions=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;altmetric-embed&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size spectrum of an ecological community characterizes how a property, such as abundance or biomass, varies with body size. Size spectra are often used as ecosystem indicators of marine systems. They have been fitted to data from various sources, including groundfish trawl surveys, visual surveys of fish in kelp forests and coral reefs, sediment samples of benthic invertebrates and satellite remote sensing of chlorophyll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decades, several methods have been used to fit size spectra to data. We document eight such methods, demonstrating their commonalities and differences. Seven methods use linear regression (of which six require binning of data), while the eighth uses maximum likelihood estimation. We test the accuracy of the meth- ods on simulated data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that estimated size-spectrum slopes are not always comparable between the seven regression- based methods because such methods are not estimating the same parameter. We find that four of the eight tested methods can sometimes give reasonably accurate estimates of the exponent of the individual size distribution (which is related to the slope of the size spectrum). However, sensitivity analyses find that maximum likelihood estimation is the only method that is consistently accurate, and the only one that yields reliable confidence inter- vals for the exponent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We therefore recommend the use of maximum likelihood estimation when fitting size spectra. To facilitate this, we provide documented R code for fitting and plotting results. This should provide consistency in future studies and improve the quality of any resulting advice to ecosystem managers. In particular, the calculation of reliable confidence intervals will allow proper consideration of uncertainty when making management decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Fishing degrades reef fish size structure</title>
      <link>https://jpwrobinson.github.io/post/size-crep/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From spears to gillnets and artisanal fishers to commercial boats, coral reef ecosystems are exploited across a range of fishing pressures and with diverse gear types. Reefs are valuable food resources for tropical coastal communities and yet our understanding of fishing impacts on reefs is often founded on studies that measure how much fish biomass is depleted in fished areas. In order to understand broader impacts on aspects of community structure we quantified reef fish size structure - the fish size distribution, or relative abundance of different body sizes - at major Pacific island groups that span gradients in human presence and environmental influences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using data collected by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Programme (NOAA), we measured the size spectrum, the large fish indicator, and total fish biomass at 38 US-affiliated islands and atolls in the Pacific Ocean, ranging from uninhabited pristine reefs (such as Palmyra atoll) to large population centres (such as Honolulu on Oahu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size spectrum is the exponent of the power law distribution of individual body sizes, and may be more widely recognised as the slope of the relationship between abundance ~ body size in log-log space [more information on fitting size spectra here]. The large fish indicator represents the biomass of large fishes relative to total fish biomass, and total fish biomass is the total mass of the fish community. We examined variation in these indicators across human population density, proximity to market centre, sea surface temperature, oceanic productivity, and 5 habitat variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results revealed that reef fish community size structure was degraded (or &amp;lsquo;steepened&amp;rsquo;) as human presence increased (Figure 1), consistent with a depletion of large-bodied fishes and a gradual shift to a communities that are dominated by small fishes. Although reef fish biomass was also depleted at high levels of human presence, all fished islands supported low biomass levels (~ 500 kg per hectare) irrespective of fishing pressure. Light size-selective fishing had a disproportionate impact on fish biomass but caused gradual shifts in size structure, and size spectra were also generally more robust to environmental variation than was fish biomass.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;Change in size spectrum exponent and reef fish biomass along proximity to market (a, c) and human population density (b, d)&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By shifting to greater dominance of small-bodied fishes, size-selective fishing produces fish communities that have faster biomass turnover times, greater vulnerability to environmental change, and depleted numbers of functionally important large-bodied individuals, such as the large grazing fish that control algal cover and large predatory fish that link pelagic food webs with the reef benthos. Size-selective exploitation has a consistent impact across marine ecosystems: the steepening spectra we describe here have also been widely documented in temperate fisheries . Such size-based indicators are robust and meaningful indicators of fishing pressure, and may be particularly effective for reef fisheries that often lack meaningful catch and effort data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future application of size-based indicators to coral reef fish communities could provide valuable insights for reef fisheries managers: for those interested in fitting size spectra or using our statistical modelling approach, here&amp;rsquo;s our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/baumlab/robinson-reefs-spectra&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.13482/abstract&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fitting size spectra to empirical data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The size spectrum describes the distribution of body sizes within a community, and is widely used among fisheries biologists to track exploitation effects and parameterise theoretical size-based ecosystem models. Most notably, empirical size spectrum estimates have provided insights into community-level changes in overfished ecosystems. In a project led by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~english/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Andrew Edwards&lt;/a&gt; (Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada) and recently published in &lt;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12641/abstract&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Methods in Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution&lt;/a&gt;, we show that empirical size-spectrum fitting methods are not standardised and many are biased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual body size distributions typically exhibit power law relationships, with an exponent b that quantifies the relative abundances of body sizes. In practice, size spectra have typically been fitted by fitting a linear regression to binned abundance and body size data in log-log space, where the slope of the regression is analagous to the power law exponent. b is negative, reflecting a decrease in abundance as body size increases, and is said to ‘steepen’ (or decrease) when fishing pressure is size-selective and large-bodied fishes are removed from the community. We tested the accuracy of different fitting methods including binned vs. unbinned data and regression vs. power law distribution fitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results indicate that maximum likelihood estimation of power law distributions gives the most accurate estimates of size spectrum exponents (b estimates). &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/andrew-edwards/fitting-size-spectra/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;We provide code&lt;/a&gt; for maximum likelihood estimation of binned and unbinned body size data, and also recommend that size spectra are presented by plotting both a log-log biomass spectrum and an untransformed abundance spectrum that allows visual inspection of every data point (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that fisheries biologists will use these tools to improve their analyses of community size spectra, and that our work has improved the utility of size spectra as indicators of ecological change.

      <title>Predator-prey mass ratios</title>
      <link>https://jpwrobinson.github.io/post/ppmr/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Predator-prey mass ratios (PPMRs) reflect the strength of interactions between predators and prey, and can be used to examine community size structure. PPMRs can be estimated using diet data (e.g. Barnes et al. 2010, Ecology) or with stable isotope methods in which an individual&amp;rsquo;s trophic position is inferred by measuring the fractionation of nitrogen 15-N relative to a baseline value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although standard &amp;lsquo;additive&amp;rsquo; approaches assume that 15-N fractionates by 3.4‰, Hussey et al. (2014, Ecol. Lett.) showed that fractionation values are dependent on tissue 15-N and so increase with trophic level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a paper led jointly by Dr. Eric Hertz (Simon Fraser University) and myself, we applied Hussey et al.&amp;rsquo;s (2014) scaled trophic fractionation model to simulated data and North Sea stable isotope data. Our results indicated that the additive stable isotope approach produces incorrect PPMR estimates, and that the extent of the bias is dependent on the baseline 15-N and the trophic level sampled. For those wishing to correctly calculate PPMR from stable isotope data, &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/baumlab/ppmr-isotopes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s the code&lt;/a&gt; that applies the Hussey et al. (2014) scaled trophic fractionation model to directly estimate PPMR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-badge-details=&#34;right&#34; data-badge-type=&#34;medium-donut&#34; data-doi=&#34;10.1139/cjfas-2015-0178&#34; data-hide-no-mentions=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;altmetric-embed&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relationships between abundance – body size and trophic position – body size can reveal size structuring in food webs and test ecological theory. Although there is considerable evidence of size structuring in temperate aquatic food webs, little is known about the structure of tropical coral reef food webs. Here, we use underwater visual-census data and nitrogen stable isotope analysis to test if coral reef fish communities (i) are size structured and (ii) follow metabolic scaling rules. After examining individuals from over 160 species spanning four orders of magnitude in body size, we show that abundance scaled negatively with body size and, as predicted, individuals sharing energy through predation (carnivorous fishes) scaled more steeply than those individuals sharing a common energy source (herbivorous fishes). Estimated size spectra were, however, shallower than predicted by metabolic theory. Trophic position scaled positively with body size across species and across individuals, providing novel evidence of size structuring in a diverse tropical food web. Size-based approaches hold great promise for integrating the complexities of food webs into simple quantitative measures, thus providing new insights into the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Size structure of coral reef fish communities</title>
      <link>https://jpwrobinson.github.io/post/size-ki/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite a strong focus on understanding patterns in the diversity, behaviour and functional roles of fish on coral reefs, we know far less about how fish communities are structured. In most aquatic communities, gape limitation and ontogenetic niche shifts produce communities that are size structured, where predators are larger than their prey. Our expectation is that reef fish communities should also be size structured, though this has not been formally tested. In a paper published in a special body size themed issue of the Canadian Journal of Fisheries &amp;amp; Aquatic Sciences, myself and Dr. Julia Baum examined the case for size structuring in the coral reef fish community at Kiritimati Atoll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Size-structured communities are characterised by two major patterns. First, there is a negative relationship between abundance and body size (or size spectrum), due to the inefficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels that constrains the  abundance of predators to be lower that that of their prey. Second, trophic position will increase with body size, reflecting the tight correlation between an individual&amp;rsquo;s body size and its position in the food web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We examined the community structure at Kiritimati (Christmas) Island, the world&amp;rsquo;s largest atoll. Using underwater visual census data and stable isotope analysis of collected fish specimens, we found strong evidence for size structuring in the reef fish community where 1) size spectrum slope was negative and 2) trophic position increased with body mass, both across species (Figure 1a, 1b) and across individuals irrespective of species (Figure 1c, 1d). These relationships improved when we considered herbivorous and carnivorous fish independently (Figure 1b, 1d).&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;Trophic position ~ body mass relationships at Kiritimati Atoll&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a direct test of metabolic theory, we also examined how abundance ~ body size relationships changed depending on how energy is used within subsets of the community. Metabolic theory predicts that individuals competing for energy through predation (i.e. across multiple trophic levels) will have steeper size spectra than individuals sharing a common energy source (i.e. within a single trophic level), simply due to the inefficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels. On Kiritimati, we examined the size spectrum of carnivores (piscivores, invertivores, planktivores, corallivores) and herbivores (herbivores and detritivores) within the fish community. As predicted, the size spectrum of our carnivore community was steeper than the size spectrum of our herbivore community (Figure 2). However, we our size spectrum slopes were generally shallower than those predicted by metabolic theory, which was likely a result of our inability to sample all individuals that contributed to energy flux within the reef food web (e.g. invertebrates and very small fishes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We detected differences in community structure within different trophic groups, indicating that is is important to consider how energy is utilised by different compartments of the food web before attempting to understand patterns in community structure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Estimation of predator-prey mass ratios using stable isotopes:
sources of errors</title>

&lt;div data-badge-details=&#34;right&#34; data-badge-type=&#34;medium-donut&#34; data-doi=&#34;10.3354/meps11079&#34; data-hide-no-mentions=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;altmetric-embed&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In aquatic systems, the ratio of predator mass to prey mass (PPMR) is an important constraint on food web structure, and has been correlated with environmental stability. One common approach of estimating PPMR uses nitrogen stable isotopes (δ15N) as an indicator of trophic position, under the assumption that the discrimination between diet and tissue is constant with increasing diet δ15N (an additive approach). However, recent studies have shown that this assumption may not be valid and that there is a negative trend between the δ15N of the diet and the discrimination value (a scaled approach). Here, we estimated PPMR for a simulated food web using both the traditional additive approach and the improved scaled approach, and then tested our predictions with isotope samples from a North Sea food web. Our simulations show that the additive approach yields incorrect estimates of PPMR, and these biases are reflected in North Sea PPMR estimates. The extent of the bias is dependent on the baseline δ15N and trophic level sampled, with the greatest differences for samples with low baseline δ15N sampled at lower trophic levels. The scaled approach allows for the comparison of PPMR across varying δ15N baselines and trophic levels, and will refine estimates of PPMR.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The limitations of diversity metrics in directing global marine
conservation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Biodiversity hotspots have been used extensively in setting conservation priorities for marine ecosystems. A recent Nature publication claims to have uncovered new latitudinal gradients in the evenness of reef communities and new reef hotspots based on functional diversity. Simulation models show that the purported evenness gradient is a mathematical inevitability of differences in species richness and detectability between vastly different marine ecosystems, namely ‘reefs’ in tropical, temperate, and polar regions. Constraints on evenness, along with disparity amongst communities in possible functional traits, cast doubt on the utility of global functional diversity comparisons for management of marine systems.&lt;/p&gt;
