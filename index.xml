      <title>Fishing degrades reef fish size structure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From spears to gillnets and artisanal fishers to commercial boats, coral reef ecosystems are exploited across a range of fishing pressures and with diverse gear types. Reefs are valuable food resources for tropical coastal communities and yet our understanding of fishing impacts on reefs is often founded on studies that measure how much fish biomass is depleted in fished areas. In order to understand broader impacts on aspects of community structure we quantified reef fish size structure - the fish size distribution, or relative abundance of different body sizes - at major Pacific island groups that span gradients in human presence and environmental influences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using data collected by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Programme (NOAA), we measured the size spectrum, the large fish indicator, and total fish biomass at 38 US-affiliated islands and atolls in the Pacific Ocean, ranging from uninhabited pristine reefs (such as Palmyra atoll) to large population centres (such as Honolulu on Oahu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;image=&amp;lsquo;CREP-map-spectra.png&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size spectrum is the exponent of the power law distribution of individual body sizes, and may be more widely recognised as the slope of the relationship between abundance ~ body size in log-log space [more information on fitting size spectra here]. The large fish indicator represents the biomass of large fishes relative to total fish biomass, and total fish biomass is the total mass of the fish community. We examined variation in these indicators across human population density, proximity to market centre, sea surface temperature, oceanic productivity, and 5 habitat variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results revealed that reef fish community size structure was degraded (or &amp;lsquo;steepened&amp;rsquo;) as human presence increased (Figure 1), consistent with a depletion of large-bodied fishes and a gradual shift to a communities that are dominated by small fishes. Although reef fish biomass was also depleted at high levels of human presence, all fished islands supported low biomass levels (~ 500 kg per hectare) irrespective of fishing pressure. Light size-selective fishing had a disproportionate impact on fish biomass but caused gradual shifts in size structure, and size spectra were also generally more robust to environmental variation than was fish biomass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[insert fig] Figure 1 - Change in size spectrum exponent and reef fish biomass along proximity to market (a, c) and human population density (b, d)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By shifting to greater dominance of small-bodied fishes, size-selective fishing produces fish communities that have faster biomass turnover times, greater vulnerability to environmental change, and depleted numbers of functionally important large-bodied individuals, such as the large grazing fish that control algal cover and large predatory fish that link pelagic food webs with the reef benthos. Size-selective exploitation has a consistent impact across marine ecosystems: the steepening spectra we describe here have also been widely documented in temperate fisheries . Such size-based indicators are robust and meaningful indicators of fishing pressure, and may be particularly effective for reef fisheries that often lack meaningful catch and effort data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future application of size-based indicators to coral reef fish communities could provide valuable insights for reef fisheries managers: for those interested in fitting size spectra or using our statistical modelling approach, here&amp;rsquo;s our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/baumlab/robinson-reefs-spectra&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.13482/abstract&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fitting size spectra to empirical data</title>
      <link>https://jpwrobinson.github.io/post/size-spectra-methods-blog/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The size spectrum describes the distribution of body sizes within a community, and is widely used among fisheries biologists to track exploitation effects and parameterise theoretical size-based ecosystem models. Most notably, empirical size spectrum estimates have provided insights into community-level changes in overfished ecosystems. In a project led by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~english/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Andrew Edwards&lt;/a&gt; (Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada) and recently published in &lt;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12641/abstract&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Methods in Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution&lt;/a&gt;, we show that empirical size-spectrum fitting methods are not standardised and many are biased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual body size distributions typically exhibit power law relationships, with an exponent b that quantifies the relative abundances of body sizes. In practice, size spectra have typically been fitted by fitting a linear regression to binned abundance and body size data in log-log space, where the slope of the regression is analagous to the power law exponent. b is negative, reflecting a decrease in abundance as body size increases, and is said to ‘steepen’ (or decrease) when fishing pressure is size-selective and large-bodied fishes are removed from the community. We tested the accuracy of different fitting methods including binned vs. unbinned data and regression vs. power law distribution fitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results indicate that maximum likelihood estimation of power law distributions gives the most accurate estimates of size spectrum exponents (b estimates). &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/andrew-edwards/fitting-size-spectra/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;We provide code&lt;/a&gt; for maximum likelihood estimation of binned and unbinned body size data, and also recommend that size spectra are presented by plotting both a log-log biomass spectrum and an untransformed abundance spectrum that allows visual inspection of every data point (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that fisheries biologists will use these tools to improve their analyses of community size spectra, and that our work has improved the utility of size spectra as indicators of ecological change. The published paper is Open Access and can be downloaded from Methods in Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predator-prey mass ratios</title>
      <link>https://jpwrobinson.github.io/post/ppmr-blog/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Predator-prey mass ratios (PPMRs) reflect the strength of interactions between predators and prey, and can be used to examine community size structure. PPMRs can be estimated using diet data (e.g. Barnes et al. 2010, Ecology) or with stable isotope methods in which an individual&amp;rsquo;s trophic position is inferred by measuring the fractionation of nitrogen 15-N relative to a baseline value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although standard &amp;lsquo;additive&amp;rsquo; approaches assume that 15-N fractionates by 3.4‰, Hussey et al. (2014, Ecol. Lett.) showed that fractionation values are dependent on tissue 15-N and so increase with trophic level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 - trophic position ~ body mass relationship produced using scaled (red) and additive (black) fractionation methods&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a paper led jointly by Dr. Eric Hertz (Simon Fraser University) and myself, we applied Hussey et al.&amp;rsquo;s (2014) scaled trophic fractionation model to simulated data and North Sea stable isotope data. Our results indicated that the additive stable isotope approach produces incorrect PPMR estimates, and that the extent of the bias is dependent on the baseline 15-N and the trophic level sampled. For those wishing to correctly calculate PPMR from stable isotope data, &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/baumlab/ppmr-isotopes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s the code&lt;/a&gt; that applies the Hussey et al. (2014) scaled trophic fractionation model to directly estimate PPMR.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Size structure of coral reef fish communities</title>
      <link>https://jpwrobinson.github.io/post/size-kiritimati-blog/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite a strong focus on understanding patterns in the diversity, behaviour and functional roles of fish on coral reefs, we know far less about how fish communities are structured. In most aquatic communities, gape limitation and ontogenetic niche shifts produce communities that are size structured, where predators are larger than their prey. Our expectation is that reef fish communities should also be size structured, though this has not been formally tested. In a paper published in a special body size themed issue of the Canadian Journal of Fisheries &amp;amp; Aquatic Sciences, myself and Dr. Julia Baum examined the case for size structuring in the coral reef fish community at Kiritimati Atoll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Size-structured communities are characterised by two major patterns. First, there is a negative relationship between abundance and body size (or size spectrum), due to the inefficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels that constrains the  abundance of predators to be lower that that of their prey. Second, trophic position will increase with body size, reflecting the tight correlation between an individual&amp;rsquo;s body size and its position in the food web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We examined the community structure at Kiritimati (Christmas) Island, the world&amp;rsquo;s largest atoll. Using underwater visual census data and stable isotope analysis of collected fish specimens, we found strong evidence for size structuring in the reef fish community where 1) size spectrum slope was negative and 2) trophic position increased with body mass, both across species (Figure 1a, 1b) and across individuals irrespective of species (Figure 1c, 1d). These relationships improved when we considered herbivorous and carnivorous fish independently (Figure 1b, 1d).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[insert fig] Figure 1 - trophic position ~ body mass relationships at Kiritimati Atoll&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a direct test of metabolic theory, we also examined how abundance ~ body size relationships changed depending on how energy is used within subsets of the community. Metabolic theory predicts that individuals competing for energy through predation (i.e. across multiple trophic levels) will have steeper size spectra than individuals sharing a common energy source (i.e. within a single trophic level), simply due to the inefficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels. On Kiritimati, we examined the size spectrum of carnivores (piscivores, invertivores, planktivores, corallivores) and herbivores (herbivores and detritivores) within the fish community. As predicted, the size spectrum of our carnivore community was steeper than the size spectrum of our herbivore community (Figure 2). However, we our size spectrum slopes were generally shallower than those predicted by metabolic theory, which was likely a result of our inability to sample all individuals that contributed to energy flux within the reef food web (e.g. invertebrates and very small fishes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We detected differences in community structure within different trophic groups, indicating that is is important to consider how energy is utilised by different compartments of the food web before attempting to understand patterns in community structure.&lt;/p&gt;
