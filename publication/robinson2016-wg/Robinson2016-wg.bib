 abstract = {Relationships between abundance -- body size and trophic
position -- body size can reveal size structuring in food webs
and test ecological theory. Although there is considerable
evidence of size structuring in temperate aquatic food webs,
little is known about the structure of tropical coral reef food
webs. Here, we use underwater visual-census data and nitrogen
stable isotope analysis to test if coral reef fish communities
(i) are size structured and (ii) follow metabolic scaling rules.
After examining individuals from over 160 species spanning four
orders of magnitude in body size, we show that abundance scaled
negatively with body size and, as predicted, individuals sharing
energy through predation (carnivorous fishes) scaled more
steeply than those individuals sharing a common energy source
(herbivorous fishes). Estimated size spectra were, however,
shallower than predicted by metabolic theory. Trophic position
scaled positively with body size across species and across
individuals, providing novel evidence of size structuring in a
diverse tropical food web. Size-based approaches hold great
promise for integrating the complexities of food webs into
simple quantitative measures, thus providing new insights into
the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems.},
