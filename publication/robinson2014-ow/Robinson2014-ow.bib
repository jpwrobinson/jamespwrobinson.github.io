 abstract = {Abstract Biodiversity hotspots have been used extensively in
setting conservation priorities for marine ecosystems. A recent
Nature publication claims to have uncovered new latitudinal
gradients in the evenness of reef communities and new reef
hotspots based on functional diversity. Simulation models show
that the purported evenness gradient is a mathematical
inevitability of differences in species richness and
detectability between vastly different marine ecosystems, namely
`reefs' in tropical, temperate, and polar regions. Constraints
on evenness, along with disparity amongst communities in
possible functional traits, cast doubt on the utility of global
functional diversity comparisons for management of marine
systems.},
