 abstract = {Environmental variability can destabilize communities by causing
correlated interspecific fluctuations that weaken the portfolio
effect, yet evidence of such a mechanism is rare in natural
systems. Here, we ask whether the population dynamics of similar
sympatric species of a seabird breeding community are
synchronized, and if these species have similar exceptional
responses to environmental variation. We used a 24-year time
series of the breeding success and population growth rate of a
marine top predator species group to assess the degree of
synchrony between species demography. We then developed a novel
method to examine the species group - all species combined -
response to environmental variability, in particular, whether
multiple species experience similar, pronounced fluctuations in
their demography. Multiple species were positively correlated in
breeding success and growth rate. Evidence of ``exceptional''
years was found, where the species group experienced pronounced
fluctuations in their demography. The synchronous response of the
species group was negatively correlated with winter sea surface
temperature of the preceding year for both growth rate and
breeding success. We present evidence for synchronous,
exceptional responses of a species group that are driven by
environmental variation. Such species covariation destabilizes
communities by reducing the portfolio effect, and such
exceptional responses may increase the risk of a state change in
this community. Our understanding of the future responses to
environmental change requires an increased focus on the
short-term fluctuations in demography that are driven by extreme
environmental variability.},
