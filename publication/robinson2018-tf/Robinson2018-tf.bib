 abstract = {Our ability to understand natural constraints on coral reef
benthic communities requires quantitative assessment of the
relative strengths of abiotic and biotic processes across large
spatial scales. Here, we combine underwater images, visual
censuses and remote sensing data for 1566 sites across 34 islands
spanning the central-western Pacific Ocean, to empirically assess
the relative roles of abiotic and grazing processes in
determining the prevalence of calcifying organisms and fleshy
algae on coral reefs. We used regression trees to identify the
major predictors of benthic composition and to test whether
anthropogenic stress at inhabited islands decouples natural
relationships. We show that sea surface temperature, wave energy,
oceanic productivity and aragonite saturation strongly influence
benthic community composition; overlooking these factors may bias
expectations of calcified reef states. Maintenance of grazing
biomass above a relatively low threshold (~ 10--20 kg ha-1) may
also prevent transitions to algal-dominated states, providing a
tangible management target for rebuilding overexploited herbivore
populations. Biophysical relationships did not decouple at
inhabited islands, indicating that abiotic influences remain
important macroscale processes, even at chronically disturbed
reefs. However, spatial autocorrelation among inhabited reefs was
substantial and exceeded abiotic and grazing influences,
suggesting that natural constraints on reef benthos were
superseded by unmeasured anthropogenic impacts. Evidence of
strong abiotic influences on reef benthic communities underscores
their importance in specifying quantitative targets for coral
reef management and restoration that are realistic within the
context of local conditions.},
