 abstract = {Fishing pressure on coral reef ecosystems has been frequently
linked to reductions of large fishes and reef fish biomass.
Associated impacts on overall community structure are, however,
less clear. In size-structured aquatic ecosystems, fishing
impacts are commonly quantified using size spectra, which
describe the distribution of individual body sizes within a
community. We examined the size spectra and biomass of coral
reef fish communities at 38 US-affiliated Pacific islands that
ranged in human presence from near pristine to human population
centers. Size spectra 'steepened' steadily with increasing human
population and proximity to market due to a reduction in the
relative biomass of large fishes and an increase in the
dominance of small fishes. Reef fish biomass was substantially
lower on inhabited islands than uninhabited ones, even at
inhabited islands with the lowest levels of human presence. We
found that on populated islands size spectra exponents decreased
(analogous to size spectra steepening) linearly with declining
biomass, whereas on uninhabited islands there was no
relationship. Size spectra were steeper in regions of low sea
surface temperature but were insensitive to variation in other
environmental and geomorphic covariates. In contrast, reef fish
biomass was highly sensitive to oceanographic conditions, being
influenced by both oceanic productivity and sea surface
temperature. Our results suggest that community size structure
may be a more robust indicator than fish biomass to increasing
human presence and that size spectra are reliable indicators of
exploitation impacts across regions of different fish community
compositions, environmental drivers, and fisheries types.
Size-based approaches that link directly to functional
properties of fish communities, and are relatively insensitive
to abiotic variation across biogeographic regions, offer great
potential for developing our understanding of fishing impacts in
coral reef ecosystems.},
